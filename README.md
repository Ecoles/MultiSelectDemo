MultiSelectDemo
============

This is a demo project created by Edgar Coles. This is to show an example of a custom made Multiselect dialog window
that interacts with a database. After fighting with the default android provided function to use a DB cursor with a
multiselect, I went and designed my won. To better my understanding of android while learning it. It is a very simple
design and also fairly crude. I am still a new developer to the world of android so I have not yet learned all the
best practices to be using. For any questions, comments or concerns please email ecoles88@gmail.com.
